Note: Depeding on where you are in the world and what ISP you are using, the above link might not open anything, this is almost certainly due to how your ISP handles DNS, there are two ways to circumvent this issue:

### 1. Using a proxy site

Use a free proxy site, like [Proxyium](https://proxyium.com/) to visit the link.

Just open the above site and paste this link: https://fromscode-mini-message-board.up.railway.app/


### 2. Configuring your browser's DNS settings

Change your browser's settings:
Instead of using the default DNS provided by your ISP, configure your browser to use Google's public DNS or Cloudfare.

Steps (for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge):
1. Open Settings
2. Privacy / Search settings
3. Security
4. Use secure DNS (turn this on)
5. Select a service provider (Google Public DNS or Cloudfare 1.1.1.1)
6. Restart the browser

Now the live link at the top of this readme should open
